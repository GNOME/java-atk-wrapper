Contributing to Java ATK Wrapper:

This is a brand new module which intends to be used to replace
java-access-bridge because of the deprecation of Bonobo.

It is still not yet feature-complete, and there must be many bugs.

The current maintainer is Magdalen Berns (m.berns@thismagpie.com).
As a general rule, non-trivial maintainer-submitted patches should be posted to
gnome-accessibility-devel for comment and informational purpose prior to commit.

Patches are welcome and if there are any suggestions, please send comments to

m.berns@thismagpie.com
