Hacking Guide for Java ATK Wrapper
==================================

As a general rule, non-trivial maintainer-submitted patches should be posted to
gnome-accessibility-devel for comment and informational purpose prior to commit.

Patches are welcome and if there are any suggestions, please send comments
directly to the current maintainer, Samuel Thibault samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org
and make sure to cc the gnome-accessibility-devel list too.

To file a bug against java-atk-wrapper:

1. go to <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/java-atk-wrapper/issues/new>
2. select java-atk-wrapper from the component list
3. file bug using a descriptive subject title
4. Wait for maintainer to accept bug or upload a patch to your bug for review

Overall picture
---------------

We have two kinds of entry points into the java-atk-wrapper code:

- events from the application
- requests from the at-spi bus


Events from the application come through the class specified in
java's assistive_technologies variable, set to
org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper. We thus end up in
wrapper/org/GNOME/Accessibility/AtkWrapper.java's methods such as
AtkWrapper::windowActivated. This calls the C version from AtkWrapper.c,
Java_org_GNOME_Accessibility_AtkWrapper_windowActivate, which emits a glib
signal, caught by ATK to send the right message on the at-spi bus.

Requests from the at-spi bus come from ATK calling our methods, for instance
jaw_object_get_name, which calls the java version AtkObject::getAccessibleName
which calls the java-provided AccessibleContext::getAccessibleName().


Request from the at-spi bus have to be processed in a glib main loop. Since
java may or may not be using a glib main loop, we have to run a glib loop in a
separate thread, called the jaw thread.  Events from the application are thus
processed from the application threads, and requests from the at-spi bus are
processed from the jaw thread.  This brings concurrency issues, thus mutexes
on hash tables etc.  Unfortunately we can not assume that the application is
thread-safe: it might be using just one thread and not lock anything.  Even
getAccessibleContext() calls may not be safe because they might involve table
lookups etc. within the application.  This is why the java versions AtkObject::*
take care of surrounding any Accessible* calls within an AtkUtil.invokeInSwing()
wrapper, to delegate running the piece of code to the application thread, the
EDT (Event Dispatch Thread).  Conversely, we can not emit glib signals etc. at
random times, so AtkWrapper.c delegates this to the idle handler of the glib
mamin loop.  We thus have some ping-pong of code execution between the two
threads, to make sure it executes safely.

In summary:
- Java_org_GNOME_Accessibility_AtkWrapper_* are called from the application
thread,
- the corresponding *_handler are called in the jaw thread,
- the jaw_* methods are called from the jaw thread,
- the corresponding Atk* methods delegate some of their work to the EDT.


Last but not least, three kinds of objects exist: the java-implemented
Accessible*, the ATK-implemented C Atk*, and its Atk* java-ish counterpart.
When an event comes from the application, the object at stake might not be
known to ATK yet.  One has to use jaw_impl_get_instance to get the existing
corresponding ATK C object, or create it, as well as the java-ish counterpart.
When java gets rid of an Accessible* object, we need to release the Atk* C and
java objects.  This is done by storing only weak references in the Atk* C and
java objects, and get notified of GC passes; object_table_gc then goes through
all Atk* C objects to check whether the weak references are still valid, and
release them otherwise.  This however also means that when a request comes from
the at-spi bus, the java object might not exist any more.  In Atk* methods, one
thus have to acquire a global reference and check that it is valid before working
on the java object and after that release the global reference.

To get a JawImpl from an AccessibleContext, one can use jaw_impl_get_instance,
but only from the application threads, since to properly create the C Atk*
and java Atk* we need to call methods from the AccessibleContext. In the jaw
thread, one can either use the quick jaw_impl_find_instance if we know that it
is supposed to exist, or we can use jaw_impl_get_instance_from_jaw which
triggers a call to jaw_impl_get_instance inside the Swing thread.


References
----------

We keep global references:

- A reference to java Atk* stored in the corresponding C Atk*
- A weak reference to AccessibleContext stored in the corresponding C Atk* acc_context
- For signal parameters stored in CallbackPara
- A reference to the C Atk* for being stored in objectTable


Methods Not Yet Fully Implemented
---------------------------------

Document Interface (not yet implemented):
  get_current_page_number
  get_page_count

HyperlinkImpl:
TODO Currently Not fully documented by ATK

# NOTE: Window interface signals currently seems to be being handled in jawobject.c
Object base class:
  AtkFunction
  implementor_ref_accessible
  get_attributes


Deprecated Methods Which Are Implemented
----------------------------------------

Table Interface:
  get_column_at_index
  get_row_at_index

Text Interface:
  get_text_at_offset     -   use get_string_at_offset instead
                             NOTE: some legacy implementations
                             need to default to get_text_at_offset


Conventions for Writing Java ATK Wrapper Code
---------------------------------------------

Spaces instead of tabs.
Four spaces per indent.

JNI warning and error messages are in the form:

  JAW_DEBUG_I("method calling instance: instance == NULL");

These statements will only be emitted to jaw_log_file.txt if the environment
variable JAW_DEBUG is set to 1. To use this setting type the following into the
terminal or set it in ~/.bashrc:

  export JAW_DEBUG=1

More JAW_DEBUG level values are available (2: JAW_DEBUG_JNI, 3: JAW_DEBUG_C, 4: JAW_DEBUG_ALL)


Other Things to Keep in Mind
----------------------------

The jint object is mapped to C's long which is always at least 32 bits), instead
of of C's int (which could be 16 bits). The resource for glib types can be
found at <https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Basic-Types.html>

JAW_GET_* acquire a global reference on the obtained jobject (because local
references are dropped when ), it needs to be released before returning in all
code paths!

TODO: probably we can safely use mere (non-weak) local references here?
