Contributing to Java ATK Wrapper:

This is a brand new module which intends to be used to replace
java-access-bridge because of the deprecation of Bonobo.

It is still not yet feature-complete, and there must be many bugs.

The current maintainer is Ke Wang (ke.wang@sun.com). As a general rule,
non-trivial maintainer-submitted patches should be posted to
gnome-accessibility-devel for comment and informational purpose prior to commit.

Patches are welcome and if there are any suggestions, please send comments to

ke.wang@sun.com
