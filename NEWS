Changes in version 0.30.5
=========================

Maintainer note: while doing this release, we detected that the
version bump on each release was not included on the master branch. So
most of the 0.30.X JAW versions available were not reflected on
master, but only on the branch gnome-2-30. In that sense, the
versioning of this module was more updated on a specific branch that
on master.

This was against the usual GNOME policies, and in general, for any
free software project using git as repository. So, from now on, the
usual policy would be used, summarized as:

 * master will include also the version bumping.
 * specific branches will be used for developing new features or to
   keep track of stable branches

Additionally, this NEWS entry will include all the changes since
0.29.5., beind those:
*
* Atk wrapping:
   * Bug 616693: emit both the visible and showing events for combo box
   * Bug 611256 - atk_text_get_text is not working correctly with the
     specified end offset
* Building:
   * Add JAVACFLAGS option for build
   * Bug 703358 - java-atk-wrapper can't be re-automake with automake 1.13
   * Use -avoid-version only when target_os is cygwin
* Mantainership:
   * Updated doap file, both in format [1] and in content (current
     active maintainers)
   * Updated AUTHORS and MAINTAINERS files accordingly
* Miscellanea
   * Use GTK_PATH to locate libatk-bridge.so
   * Use AT_SPI_IOR and AT_SPI_BUS instead of GConf key to check
     enablement of accessibility
   * Adding initial .gitignore file
