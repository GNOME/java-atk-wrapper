Java ATK Wrapper is a implementation of ATK by using JNI technic.
It converts Java Swing events into ATK events, and sends these events to
ATK-Bridge.

JAW is part of the Bonobo deprecation project. By talking to ATK-Bridge, it
keeps itself from being affected by the change of underlying communication
mechanism.

JAW consists of two major parts:

wrapper:  the Java library that listens to Swing events, and adapting JAAPI
          to fit the interfaces of ATK

jni:      the C library that converts Swing events into GSignals and talks
          to ATK-Bridge
