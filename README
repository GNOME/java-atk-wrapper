Java ATK Wrapper is a implementation of ATK by using JNI technic.
It converts Java Swing events into ATK events, and sends these events to
ATK-Bridge.

JAW is part of the Bonobo deprecation project. By talking to ATK-Bridge, it
keeps itself from being affected by the change of underlying communication
mechanism.

JAW consists of two major parts:

wrapper:  the Java library that listens to Swing events, and adapting JAAPI
          to fit the interfaces of ATK

jni:      the C library that converts Swing events into GSignals and talks
          to ATK-Bridge


Note:
JAW is known to work at least with openjdk-8. Support in later versions vary,
Oracle does not seem to have realized that the latest versions are just not able
to load JAW, see Oracle incident 9127367

For some versions, one may have to enable by hand by uncommenting in e.g.
/etc/java-8-openjdk/accessibility.properties :

    assistive_technologies=org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper

For old versions, in /etc/java-7-openjdk/swing.properties one has to enable the
GTK look&feel:

    swing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel
